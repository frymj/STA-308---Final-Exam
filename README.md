# STA-308---Final-Exam

Answer the following in the Readme file in the GitHub repository.  (20pts)
A. In your own words, write a short paragraph (one or two sentences) that explains the coefficient of variation.
B. Compare/contrast the average and variation of the percent differences in the price of Diesel to Regular gasoline in the four census regions (use the
   coefficient of variation).
C. Construct a table in the Readme file on the GitHub site that provides a mapping of the R functionality you used with the Python functionality you used
   IN THIS ASSIGNMENT (see Example Mapping Table below).
D. Write a short review of your favorite topic and/or material from the course (what was it and why?)  -- this could be a particular data example, or
   methodology or curricular topic.

A. The coefficient of variation is the ratio of the standard deviation and the mean. It is used to show, in context of this assignment's data,
   the average variability of a region's mean percent difference in Diesel vs. Regular fuel costs. In other words, how much we would expect
   a random state within the region to vary from the regional average.
C. (Made more sense)

| Region    | Regional Average Percent Increase | Regiional Standard Deviation | Regional Coefficient of Variation |
|-----------|-----------------------------------|------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Midwest   | 50.3988                           | 7.9251                       | 15.7248                           |
| Northeast | 55.8164                           | 3.0244                       | 5.4185                            |
| Southwest | 57.3506                           | 3.8851                       | 6.7743                            |
| West      | 33.3906                           | 14.0690                      | 42.2373                           |

B. As displayed in the table, the average percent increase in cost of Diesel vs. Regular in the Northeast is the second-highest, yet has the lowest 
   coefficient of variation, meaning that the difference in fuel prices is, on average, the highest, yet the states' increases are all very similar.
   The Southwest is in a similar position with the highest average percent increase and the second-lowest coefficient of variation, drawing a similar 
   conclusion as that for the Northeast.
   As for the Midwest, the average percent increase in fuel costs is the second-lowest (while still very close to the Northeast and Southwest) with 
   a coefficient of variation that is noticeably higher than the Northeast and Southwest.
   The West, however, is quite the opposite of the other three regions. With the lowest average percent increase, the increase in price of Diesel vs.
   Regular is not as dramatic as the other three regions, however the variability, as displayed in the coefficient of variation, between the individual
   States is quite dramatic (42.2373%).
D. My favorite topic covered in the class was writing functions and simulations in R. It was probably the hardest module and I probably performed the
   worst in this module, but it was very satisfying seeing the function I wrote finally work after hours of trying.
